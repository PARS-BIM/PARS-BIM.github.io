# Pick by Filter
Using this command you can select elements in active view by rules already defined in filter section of Visibility Geraphics window.
The good point is you can define multiple and complex rules in Visibility Geraphics filter. For example in this way you can set a rule to select only Domestic cold water pipes with diameters of higher than 50 mm.
## Steps
1- Define rules in Visibility Geraphics - filter section. Then you can select the filter you have already created. Click on "Pick in view". Now, in active view if you select elements, only elements with defined rules will be selected and filtered.
