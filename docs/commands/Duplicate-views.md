# Duplicate Views

## Steps
1. First, select the levels for which you want to create new views based on the view templates.

2. Load your clash report.
3. Double-click a clash to zoom to its location.
4. Use filters (by category, severity, status) to focus the list.

## Tips
- For heavy projects, prepare simplified working views.
- Keep clash IDs stable when regenerating reports.
