2. If you want to insert a new sheet on the top of the list, use "Insert on top" button.
3. To add a new sheet at the end of the list, use "Insert at last" button.
4. If you want to add a new sheet below or on the top of a specific row, use "Insert below selected row" or "Insert above selected row" button.
5. You can Move up or move down a sheet. To do this, use "Move up" or " Move down" button.
6. To delete a sheet, use "Delete selected".

## Note
- Every new sheet that adds to the project needs a titleblock. You can select a titleblock or load a new one from "Title block for new sheets" section.
- Sheet numbers will re-number automatically by every change.
