# Grids dimensions
This command helps you to create dimensions between grids automatically.


1- Click on "doors" and then, from the provided list, select the widths detected by the plugin that correspond to the actual doors widths in the project, and uncheck any unnecessary widths. You can also place doors by detecting AutoCAD blocks (continue at step 4).
